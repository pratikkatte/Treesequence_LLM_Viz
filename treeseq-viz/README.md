# Treesequence Vizualization 


### Implementation Brainstorm. 
1. Deck.gl - For tree-sequence visualization. (module similar to taxonium)?
2. MobX-State-Tree - Provides configurability and flexibility for dynamically changing visualizations. (Inspired by how JBrowse works.)
3. LLM-RAG (Langchain) - for natural query parsing and generation relevant configurations for front-end.
